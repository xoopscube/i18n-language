## Definition

In computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages, 
regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale.
Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. 
Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components. 
Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization 
(which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).

## Naming
The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n 
(where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word internationalization, 
a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s)
and L10n for localization, due to the length of the words.
